# Hono + Remix Cloudflare Boilerplate Features

A boilerplate for building scalable serverless apps on Cloudflare Workers with Hono and Remix. Below is a detailed list of features:

---

## **Core Features**

1. **Hono Framework**
   - Lightweight and fast framework for building API routes and middleware.
   - Optimized for serverless environments like Cloudflare Workers.

2. **Remix Integration**
   - Simplified route management with edge-optimized rendering.
   - Seamless integration with Hono for hybrid serverless applications.

3. **Cloudflare KV Support**
   - Built-in integration with Cloudflare KV for persistent data storage.
   - KV is used as a session driver for managing user sessions.

4. **Middleware for Remix Routes**
   - Add custom middleware for specific or grouped Remix routes.
   - Middleware can be used for authentication, logging, or other custom logic.

5. **Modular File Structure**
   - Clean and organized project structure for effortless development.
   - Separation of concerns with dedicated folders for API controllers, Remix pages, middleware, and utilities.

6. **Ready-to-Use Boilerplate**
   - Comes with example API routes, Remix pages, and middleware.
   - Just clone, configure, and start building your application.

## **Key Features in Detail**

### **1. Hono API Routes**
- Define API routes using Hono's lightweight router at `routes/api.ts`.
- Example API route:
  ```typescript
  import { Hono } from 'hono';
  import { index as apiIndex, SessionSet } from '@/app/hono-api/ApiController';

  export const router = new Hono();
  router.get('/', apiIndex);
  router.get('/set-session', SessionSet);
  ```

### **2. Remix Pages and Routes**
- Simplified route management for Remix pages at `routes/remix.ts`.
- Example Remix route:
  ```javascript
  Route('/', './app/remix/pages/Index.tsx');
  Route('/kv-session', './app/remix/pages/Session.tsx');
  Route('/kv', './app/remix/pages/KV.tsx');
  ```

### **3. Middleware Support**
- Add custom middleware for Remix or Hono routes.
- Example middleware:
  ```typescript
    class TestMiddleware extends BaseMiddleware {
  
        public async boot(context: Context, next: Next) {
          await next()
        }
    }
  
    export default TestMiddleware;
  ```

### **4. Cloudflare KV Integration**
- Use Cloudflare KV for persistent data storage or session management.
- Configure KV in `wrangler.toml`:
  ```toml
  [[kv_namespaces]]
  binding = "MY_KV_NAMESPACE" # Replace with your KV namespace
  id = "<YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE_ID>"
  ```

### **5. Environment Configuration**
- Easily manage environment variables/config in `config/app.ts`.
 

### **6. Static Assets**
- Serve static assets from the `public` folder.
- Middleware for static asset registration is included.

### **7. Development and Deployment Scripts**
- **`npm run dev`**: Start the local development server with `miniflare`.
- **`npm run build`**: Build the project for production.
- **`npm run deploy`**: Deploy the application to Cloudflare Workers.

---

## **Optional Features**

### **1. Disable KV Integration**
- If you don't need KV, comment out the `KvSession` middleware in `config/app.ts`:
  ```typescript
  middlewares: [
     // KvSession,
     StaticAssetsRegister,
     RemixMiddleware,
     RemixRegister,
  ]
  ```

### **2. Disable Remix Middleware**
- If you don't need middleware for Remix routes, comment out `RemixMiddleware`:
  ```typescript
  middlewares: [
      KvSession,
      StaticAssetsRegister,
     // RemixMiddleware,
      RemixRegister,
  ]
  ```
